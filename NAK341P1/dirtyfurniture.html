      <p>Dirty Furniture is an independent design magazine that uncovers the relationship between people and the things they live with. Dirty Furniture is conceived as a finite series of six, each taking a piece of furniture as its theme. Instead of dismissing furniture as a topic fit only for glossy lifestyle publications, Dirty Furniture instead uses it as a springboard to explore topics spanning politics, history, technology, psychology, manufacturingâ€¦and the plain weird.
