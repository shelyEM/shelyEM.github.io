        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:  Design Journal Prompt -What did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own design.</p>
        <p>Response: I chose Oyatsupan, a Japanese bakery in Beaverton because I'm originally from Japan, and miss authentic Japanese breads and sweets that people from my country make. Right now the website is clean and minimal but a bit disorganized and boring. I thought this might be a great opportunity to make it more sophisticated yet creative that bring appetite to visitors. I will be focusing on simplicity and beauty of white space to emphasize Oyatsupan's delicious stuff. First website is <a href="https://global.toraya-group.co.jp/">Toraya Confectionery</a>. Another one is<a href="http://sauvageny.com/">Sauvage ny</a>. I like both sites </p>
